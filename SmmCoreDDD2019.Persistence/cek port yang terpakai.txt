Checking which application is using a port:
Open the command prompt - start » run » cmd or start » All Programs » Accessories » Command Prompt.
Type netstat -aon | findstr '[port_number]'. Replace the [port_number] with the actual port number that you want to check and hit enter.
If the port is being used by any application, then that application’s detail will be shown. The number, which is shown at the last column of the list, is the PID  (process ID) of that application. Make note of this.
Type tasklist | findstr '[PID]'. Replace the [PID] with the number from the above step and hit enter.
